# TrakMe-ionic4-app-for-traccar-server-using-leaflet
 The mobile application is developed for Android and iOS systems, named TrackMe, under Ionic 4. The goal is to track all types of connected objects and to check the status of each object (battery level and status: in line, offline) and to display the history of each object for a month of circulation. Even the application is able to calculate the shortest path for the position of the object relative to the current position of the user. it was developed using traccar as a server and leafletJs as an interactive map API and OSRM as a routing engine
